            <p>I enjoy how in this smiski there are two little guys together. A joyout display of friendship.</p>

            <p>this smiski brings me much joy. He seems so happy and enjoyable. One of the times you can see him open his mouth.</p>

            <p>I am a fan of this smiski. He is playing his silly little instrument. 10/10 experience.</p>

            <p>I like how confident this smiski looks. A very striking pose is seen here. I also enjoy the little detail of his face on the baton.</p>

    <div class="About">
        <h1 id= "About">About this Page ˙⋆✮</h1>
        <p>According to the official website: Smiski are curious little creatures that love hiding in small spaces and corners of your room. Although they like to stay hidden, you might discover one at night as they misteriously glow in the dark. It is interesting to see the many types of Smiski all with different personalities and character.</p>
        <p>There is nothing much about this page honestly. I am overall a big fan of smiskis!! I do not have a collection of my own but I do find them endearing. Every cute little fellows. </p>
        <p>I think it is understandable how popular smiskis are. They are very simplistic that anyone can find them enjoyable. There are so little details that no one can find issue within them. They are also objectively very cute.</p>
        <p>They are a very popular collectors toy and I would love to have one in the future</p>
